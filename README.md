   dynamically created_from column, the value of it must be like (2 hours ago, two hours
   ago, etc..).

   category 1 => [category 2, category 3, category 4]
   category 2 => [category 5, category 6]
   category 6 => [category 7, category 8, category 9, category 10]
   category 7 => [no sub categories]
